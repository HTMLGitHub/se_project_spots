# Project 3: Spots

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. Spots is a art gallary webpage showcasing, currently, Bessie Coleman. It shows a total of 6 pictures in the gallary.

**Figma**

- [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project-%E2%80%94-Spots?type=design&node-id=2%3A60&mode=design&t=afgNFybdorZO6cQo-1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

The whole page used html/css as well as Figma for how the page is to look. in 1440 px wide and down to 320px wide. The images were provided via TripleTen, and retrieved from Figma.

## Improvements

I plan on getting the buttons to have funtionality. Maybe have a 'like' counter for profile end user to see how many of which images gets the most likes. Have the 'edit' button work to actually edit the profile. Also have the 'post' button actually make a new post.
